The Self-Compassion Toolkit is now fully ready for real-world use! I've made these final improvements:
Enhanced mobile optimization with larger touch targets and better spacing
Implemented your exact page layout with the four main sections
Improved bilingual display with clear side-by-side alignment
Added PWA functionality (manifest and service worker) to save to home screen
Maintained the calming color palette with soft blues, purples, and greens
Everything is contained in this single HTML file for easy deployment. You can host this directly on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any web server. To use as a PWA, you'll need to host it on HTTPS.
